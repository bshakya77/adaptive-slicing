    "**Notes: Truncated NMS is a filtered version of NMS**\n",
    "- NMS is a post-processing method to remove the redundant predictions while merging.\n",
    "- **Task**: Convert Provided Truncated Non Maximum Suppression (NMS) algorithm to python version.\n",
    "- First one is simple conversion of algorithm to python code version as it is.\n",
    "- Second one is original Non Maximum Suppression (NMS). Truncated NMS is a filtered version of NMS.\n",
    "- Third one is the Truncated NMS version converted in the form of NMS code. Basically, it does all the preliminary calculation like area calculated, sorting, IoU calculation as NMS code. Just, it adds few more condition to filter out some overlapping predictions based on IoOt and IoIt if the condition meets."
